		<p>The <strong>Grateful Dead</strong> was an American rock band formed in 1965 in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palo_Alto,_California" target="_blank"> Palo Alto, California.</a> Ranging from quintet to septet, the band is known for its unique and eclectic style, which fused elements of rock, folk, country, bluegrass, blues, gospel, modal jazz, reggae, experimental music, psychedelia, and space rock, for live performances of lengthy instrumental jams, and for their devoted fan base, known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deadhead" target="_blank">"Deadheads"</a>. "Their music", writes <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lenny_Kaye" target="_blank"> Lenny Kaye</a>, "touches on ground that most other groups don't even know exists". These various influences were distilled into a diverse and psychedelic whole that made the Grateful Dead "the pioneering Godfathers of the jam band world". The band was ranked 57th by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rolling_Stone" target="_blank">Rolling Stone</a> magazine in its The Greatest Artists of All Time issue. The band was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1994 and a recording of their <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornell_5/8/77" target="_blank">May 8, 1977, performance</a> at Cornell University's Barton Hall was added to the National Recording Registry of the Library of Congress in 2012. The Grateful Dead have sold more than 35 million albums worldwide.</p>

		<p>The Grateful Dead was founded in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornell_5/8/77" target="_blank">San Francisco Bay Area</a> amid the rise of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Counterculture_of_the_1960s" target="_blank">counterculture of the 1960s</a>. The founding members were <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerry_Garcia" target="_blank">Jerry Garcia</a> (lead guitar, vocals), <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Weir" target="_blank">Bob Weir</a> (rhythm guitar, vocals), <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ron_%22Pigpen%22_McKernan" target="_blank">Ron "Pigpen" McKernan</a> (keyboards, harmonica, vocals), <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phil_Lesh" target="_blank">Phil Lesh</a> (bass, vocals), and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Kreutzmann" target="_blank">Bill Kreutzmann</a> (drums). Members of the Grateful Dead had played together in various San Francisco bands, including Mother McCree's Uptown Jug Champions and the Warlocks. Lesh was the last member to join the Warlocks before they became the Grateful Dead; he replaced Dana Morgan Jr., who had played bass for a few gigs. Drummer <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mickey_Hart" target="_blank">Mickey Hart</a> and nonperforming lyricist <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Hunter_(lyricist)" target="_blank">Robert Hunter</a> joined in 1967. With the exception of McKernan, who died in 1973, and Hart, who took time off from 1971 to 1974, the core of the band stayed together for its entire 30-year history. The other official members of the band are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Constanten" target="_blank">Tom Constanten</a> (keyboards; 1968–1970), <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Perry_Barlow" target="_blank">John Perry Barlow</a> (nonperforming lyricist; 1971–1995)[17], <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keith_Godchaux" target="_blank">Keith Godchaux</a> (keyboards; 1971–1979), <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donna_Godchaux" target="_blank">Donna Godchaux</a> (vocals; 1972–1979), <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brent_Mydland" target="_blank">Brent Mydland</a> (keyboards, vocals; 1979–1990), and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vince_Welnick" target="_blank">Vince Welnick</a> (keyboards, vocals; 1990–1995). <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruce_Hornsby" target="_blank">Bruce Hornsby</a> (accordion, piano, vocals) was a touring member from 1990 to 1992, as well as a guest with the band on occasion before and after the tours.</p>

		<p>After the death of Garcia in 1995, former members of the band, along with other musicians, toured as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Other_Ones" target="_blank">the Other Ones</a> in 1998, 2000, and 2002, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Dead_(band)" target="_blank">the Dead</a> in 2003, 2004, and 2009. In 2015, the four surviving core members marked the band's 50th anniversary in a series of concerts that were billed as their last performances together. There have also been several spin-offs featuring one or more core members, such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dead_%26_Company" target="_blank">Dead & Company</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Furthur_(band)" target="_blank">Furthur</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhythm_Devils" target="_blank">the Rhythm Devils</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phil_Lesh_%26_Friends" target="_blank">Phil Lesh & Friends</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RatDog" target="_blank">RatDog</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billy_%26_the_Kids" target="_blank"> Billy & the Kids</a>.</p>

	<div> <!-- This div is for SECTION THREE & FOUR: the following 2 subsections of the Grateful Dead Wikipedia page, with an unorder list of artwork associated with the band and images/captions integrated.-->

	<h3>Formation</h3>

	<p>The Grateful Dead began their career as the Warlocks, a group formed in early 1965 from the remnants of a Palo Alto, California jug band called Mother McCree's Uptown Jug Champions. The band's first show was at Magoo's Pizza located at 639 Santa Cruz Avenue in suburban Menlo Park, California, on May 5, 1965. They were initially known as the Warlocks; coincidentally, the Velvet Underground (similarly influenced by avant-garde music) was also using that name on the East Coast. The show was not recorded but the set list has been preserved. Gigging as a bar band, the group quickly changed its name after finding out that another band of the same name (not the Velvet Underground, who by then had also changed their name) had signed a recording contract. The first show under the new name Grateful Dead was in San Jose, California on December 4, 1965, at one of Ken Kesey's Acid Tests. Earlier demo tapes have survived, but the first of over 2,000 concerts known to have been recorded by the band's fans was a show at the Fillmore Auditorium in San Francisco on January 8, 1966. Later that month, the Grateful Dead played at the Trips Festival, an early psychedelic rock concert.</p>

	<p>The name "Grateful Dead" was chosen from a dictionary. According to Phil Lesh, in his autobiography (pp. 62), "... [Jerry Garcia] picked up an old Britannica World Language Dictionary ... [and] ... In that silvery elf-voice he said to me, 'Hey, man, how about the Grateful Dead?'" The definition there was "the soul of a dead person, or his angel, showing gratitude to someone who, as an act of charity, arranged their burial." According to Alan Trist, director of the Grateful Dead's music publisher company Ice Nine, Garcia found the name in the Funk & Wagnalls Folklore Dictionary, when his finger landed on that phrase while playing a game of Fictionary. In the Garcia biography, Captain Trips, author Sandy Troy states that the band was smoking the psychedelic DMT at the time. The term "grateful dead" appears in folktales of a variety of cultures.</p>

	<p>Other supporting personnel who signed on early included Rock Scully, who heard of the band from Kesey and signed on as manager after meeting them at the Big Beat Acid Test; Stewart Brand, "with his side show of taped music and slides of Indian life, a multimedia presentation" at the Big Beat and then, expanded, at the Trips Festival; and Owsley Stanley, the "Acid King" whose LSD supplied the tests and who, in early 1966, became the band's financial backer, renting them a house on the fringes of Watts and buying them sound equipment. "We were living solely off of Owsley's good graces at that time. ... [His] trip was he wanted to design equipment for us, and we were going to have to be in sort of a lab situation for him to do it", said Garcia.</p>

	<h3>Artwork</h3>
	
	<p>Over the years, a number of iconic images have come to be associated with the Grateful Dead. Many of these images originated as artwork for concert posters or album covers.</p>

	<ul>
		<li class="list"> Skull and Roses </li>
		<p>The skull and roses design was composed by Alton Kelley and Stanley Mouse, who added lettering and color, respectively, to a black and white drawing by Edmund Joseph Sullivan. Sullivan's drawing was an illustration for a 1913 edition of the Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam. Earlier antecedents include the custom of exhibiting the relic skulls of Christian martyrs decorated with roses on their feast days. The rose is an attribute of Saint Valentine, who according to one legend, was martyred by decapitation. Accordingly, in Rome, at the church dedicated to him, the observance of his feast day included the display of his skull surrounded by roses.[113] Kelley and Mouse's design originally appeared on a poster for the September 16 and 17, 1966 Dead shows at the Avalon Ballroom.[114] Later, it was used as the cover for the album Grateful Dead (1971). The album is sometimes referred to as Skull and Roses.[115]</p>

		<li class="list"> Jester </li>
		<p>Another icon of the Dead is a skeleton dressed as a jester and holding a lute. This image was an airbrush painting, created by Stanley Mouse in 1972. It was originally used for the cover of The Grateful Dead Songbook.</p>


		<li class="list"> Dancing Bears </li>
		<p>A series of stylized dancing bears was drawn by Bob Thomas as part of the back cover for the album History of the Grateful Dead, Volume One (Bear's Choice) (1973). Thomas reported that he based the bears on a lead sort from an unknown font.[118] The bear is a reference to Owsley "Bear" Stanley, who recorded and produced the album. Bear himself wrote, "the bears on the album cover are not really 'dancing'. I don't know why people think they are; their positions are quite obviously those of a high-stepping march."

	</figure>
		</p>

		<li class="list"> Steal Your Face Skull </li>
		<p>Perhaps the best-known Grateful Dead art icon is a red, white, and blue skull with a lightning bolt through it. The lightning bolt skull can be found on the cover of the album Steal Your Face (1976), and the image is sometimes known by that name. It was designed by Owsley Stanley and artist Bob Thomas, and was originally used as a logo to mark the band's equipment.</p>

		<li class="list"> Dancing Terrapins </li>
		<p>The two dancing terrapins first appeared on the cover of the album Terrapin Station (1977). They were drawn by Kelley and Mouse, based on a drawing by Heinrich Kley. Since then these turtles have become one of the Grateful Dead's most recognizable logos.</p>

		<li class="list"> Uncle Sam Skeleton </li>
		<p>The Uncle Sam skeleton was devised by Gary Gutierrez as part of the animation for The Grateful Dead Movie (1977).[120] The image combines the Grateful Dead skeleton motif with the character of Uncle Sam, a reference to the then-recently written song "U.S. Blues", which plays during the animation.</p>
